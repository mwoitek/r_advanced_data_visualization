## Advanced Data Visualization with R

This repo contains my solution to the three programming assignments of this
course. For each assignment, I have two versions of the solution. Specifically,
the assignments are presented as Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown files. The
notebooks allow you to see the code and the corresponding output here on
GitHub. And the Rmd files are the ones I used to create the HTML pages
I submitted for grading.

The Jupyter notebooks can be found here:

1. [Advanced ggplot Figures](https://github.com/mwoitek/r_advanced_data_visualization/blob/master/assignment_1/peer_review_1.ipynb)
1. [Spatial Figures](https://github.com/mwoitek/r_advanced_data_visualization/blob/master/assignment_2/peer_review_2.ipynb)
1. [Animations and Interactivity](https://github.com/mwoitek/r_advanced_data_visualization/blob/master/assignment_3/peer_review_3.ipynb)

**Note:** You won't be able to see the interactive plots of the last
assignment. But not because there's a problem with the corresponding Jupyter
notebook. Its code works. It's just that GitHub can't display this kind of
graphics. I decided to include this notebook anyway, for the sake of
completeness.

The solutions as R Markdown files are listed below:

1. [Advanced ggplot Figures](https://github.com/mwoitek/r_advanced_data_visualization/blob/master/assignment_1/peer_review_1_final.Rmd)
1. [Spatial Figures](https://github.com/mwoitek/r_advanced_data_visualization/blob/master/assignment_2/peer_review_2_final.Rmd)
1. [Animations and Interactivity](https://github.com/mwoitek/r_advanced_data_visualization/blob/master/assignment_3/peer_review_3_final.Rmd)
